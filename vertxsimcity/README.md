JavaFX is bundled with JRE 8 and JDK 8. The JavaFX jar is jfxrt.jar and resides in the ext folder. To deploy an application the only requisite is that the JRE 8 is properly installed.

There are similarities between JavaFX and Swing, but also differences. The best way to start is by reading the documentation available at the JDK site. Be careful to read JavaFX 8 pages and not JavaFX 2 pages as there are some differences and some old examples might not work.
