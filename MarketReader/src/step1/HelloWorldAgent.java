/**
 * A simple agent, having a default GUI, and that lives 10 seconds and quit.

 * 
 * #jws helloworld.ex01.HelloWorldAgent jws#
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Here we just: 1. extend the madkit.kernel.Agent class 2. override key methods
 * (each being optional): - activate: the first behavior in the life cycle of an
 * agent. It could be considered as a constructor which is called once the agent
 * is launched, so that it can use agent primitives. It will be a good place to
 * initialize the agent's position in the artificial society. - live: this
 * behavior is automatically called when the agent exits the activate method.
 * Usually it implements a infinite loop as it corresponds to the life of the
 * agent. - end: this behavior is automatically called when live exits or when
 * the agent is killed. Usually it is used to release resources and log the end
 * of life event. The default name of the agent is the name of the class + the
 * ID of the agent which corresponds to an instantiation number. Here the name
 * should be HelloWorldAgent-02. This is because there are always two agents
 * priorly launched: - Agent-0: The kernel agent - Agent-1: The GUI manager
